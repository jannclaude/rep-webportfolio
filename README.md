## Welcome to my Web Portfolio

This web portofolio was conceptualized and designed by ME!. 

### Design inspiration

The dark rounded containers with thin, light borders and navigation bars are inspired from GitHub UI design while also following the dark mode theme. The top blur on the website is inspired by iOS UI design to give a modernized, minimalistic aesthetic to the website. The flipping card is inspired by Instagram's dynamic profile picture flip animation.
